This is a minimal example of how to spawn a new process, run an executable in that process, set environment variables and arguments on the child process and read from the stdout of the executable running in the new process

To use:
1. change the last line of build.sh: specify as argument the path to the executable to run in the child process

2. run build.sh (it is a very simple script, a few lines only)
